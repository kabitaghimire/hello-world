# 🌍 Global Smart-Display Dashboard

A minimalist, high-contrast digital dashboard designed for wall-mounted tablets or smart TVs. This project features a rotating display of time, date, and real-time weather for three key locations: **Auburn (Sydney)**, **Kathmandu**, and **Dallas**.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Automatic Rotation**: Seamlessly switches between city cards every 19 seconds.
* **Dynamic Weather**: Integrated with the Open-Meteo API for real-time temperature updates.
* **Cultural Context**: Includes a live Nepali Tithi (Lunar Calendar) display and Bikram Sambat date conversion for the Kathmandu view.
* **Holiday Intelligence**: Automated detection of NSW (Australia) public holidays with dedicated status slides.
* **Dark-Mode Optimized**: Pure black background (`#000`) to prevent screen glow at night and protect hardware from OLED burn-in.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5 / CSS3**: Responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handles time-zone offsets, lunar calculations, and asynchronous API fetching.
* **GitHub Pages**: Fully hosted and automated deployment.
